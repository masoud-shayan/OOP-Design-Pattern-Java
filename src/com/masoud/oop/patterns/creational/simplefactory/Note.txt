The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.

it delegates object creation to subclasses that implemented the factory method .

Simple Factory has a problem, it violates the Open Close Principle in D_VehicleFactory when we add a new Implementation.
