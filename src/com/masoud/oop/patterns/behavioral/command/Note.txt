Command is behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operations into objects.

it decouples the objects that create commands from the objects that execute those commands (Command Handler),
providing more flexibility and modularity in the system.


The main motivation for using the Command pattern is that the executor of the command does not need to know anything
at all about what the command is, what context information it needs on or what it does. All of that is encapsulated in
the command.
