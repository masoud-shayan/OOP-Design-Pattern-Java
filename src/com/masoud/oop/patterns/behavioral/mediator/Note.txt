The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that helps objects communicate with each other in a more organized
and indirect way. Instead of directly interacting with each other, objects communicate through a central mediator,
which acts as an intermediary.

Imagine a situation where you have multiple objects in a system, and they need to collaborate and exchange information.
Without a mediator, these objects would have to be aware of each other, leading to tight coupling and complexity.
But with the Mediator pattern, the objects only need to know about the mediator, not each other.

The mediator allows objects to send messages to other objects, and it handles the routing and coordination of
these messages. This way, objects are decoupled and can focus on their specific tasks, leading to a more
maintainable and flexible system.


The intent of the Mediator Pattern is to reduce the complexity and dependencies between tightly coupled objects
communicating directly with one another. This is achieved by creating a mediator object that takes care of the
interaction between dependent objects. Consequently, all the communication goes through the mediator.
