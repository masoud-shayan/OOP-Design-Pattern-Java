Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a
base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in a method,
but allows subclasses to override specific steps of that algorithm without changing its overall structure.


In simpler words, the Template Design Pattern provides a blueprint for an algorithm, where certain steps are
fixed and defined in a base class (the template), while other steps can be customized in derived classes.
